;; This library implements functionalities that use Applescript.

;;; Code:

(require 'frame)

;; XXX: Unquote more reliably.

  "Unquote a STRING returned by `do-applescript'."
  (replace-regexp-in-string (regexp-quote "\"") "" string))

  "Return the current (frontmost) app."
  (pullover-osa--unquote
   (do-applescript "
tell application \"System Events\"
     bundle identifier of first application process whose frontmost is true
end tell
")))

(defun pullover-osa--copy-text (bundle-id)
  "Copy text from the app identified by BUNDLE-ID.

The copied text is put into the clipboard.

If BUNDLE-ID is nil, copy from the current (frontmost) app instead.

Return the bundle ID of the affected app. If the app is Emacs itself, return nil
without trying to copy.

Unlike `pullover-dyn--copy-text', this does not display a notification message if
the app takes too long to copy the text."
