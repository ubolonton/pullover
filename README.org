* Pullover
Texting while driving (other apps) is dangerous. Let's pull over there to edit the text in Emacs instead!

#+ATTR_HTML: :style border: 2px solid #ccc;
[[./pullover.gif]]

*Note*: This currently only works on macOS.
** Installation
- Download and extract the tar archive.
- Add the extracted directory to =load-path=.
- Load the package and start the Emacs server.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (require 'pullover)
      (server-start)
#+end_src

*** Global Shortcut Configuration
- Assign a global shortcut to the wrapper script [[./pullover-start-or-finish][pullover-start-or-finish]], using an app like [[https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements][Karabiner Elements]].
- Add the shortcut-handling app to the list in =System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility=. Usually the macOS will ask for this on first use, but sometimes it won't. It's a good idea to add the app to the list in advance.

**** Karabiner Elements
My =karabiner.json= config looks similar to this:
#+begin_src json
  "profiles": [{
    "complex_modifications": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "manipulators": [
            {
              "type": "basic",
              "from": {"modifiers": {"mandatory": ["command", "control"]}, "key_code": "e"},
              "to": [{"shell_command": "~/.emacs.d/lib/pullover/pullover-start-or-finish"}]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }]
#+end_src
The app to give Accessibility permissions is =karabiner_console_user_server=, not the main =Karabiner Elements= app itself. It is usually located at =/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-Elements/bin/karabiner_console_user_server=.

** Usage
- Press the global shortcut while inside another app to pull text from the current editing area over into Emacs.
- Edit the text as usual.
- After you are done, press the same shortcut (while inside Emacs) to end the editing session, sending the text back to the original app.
- To discard the edited text and return to the original app, use the command =pullover-cancel=, which overrides =kill-buffer= in pullover buffers.

** Customization
You can specify the major mode to use for editing.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pullover
    :custom (pullover-major-mode 'gfm-mode)
    :config (server-start))
#+end_src

If your =Emacs.app= is installed in a non-standard location, you should customize =pullover-emacsclient-command=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pullover
    :custom
    (pullover-emacsclient-command "/Applications/MacPorts/EmacsMac.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient"))
#+end_src

If the original app takes too long to copy text to the clipboard, the pullover buffer may not be populated correctly. You can give the app more time by configuring =pullover-clipboard-timeout=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pullover
    :custom (pullover-clipboard-timeout 200))
#+end_src
